Some projects might involve complex computing methods but only a few lines of code to implement (these would probably result in a project with a much longer introduction or computational background explaining these complex methods, but the code would be fairly short). Some might involve fairly simple methods to understand, but require a lot of programming (in this case, the intro/computational background may be shorter but the codes will be longer). Based on the weight of the term project and the amount of time you have to do it, I am expecting an amount of work that is the equivalent of 2 regular course labs (in terms of time spent on the project). Reports will be due Wednesday Dec. 4, 2019. However, there is a NO-PENALTY extension until Wednesday Dec. 18 at 5:00pm. This extension deadline is strict. Make sure to hand in your project long before this deadline so that there is no issue with being just over the due date/time. Work handed in after Wednesday Dec. 18 at 5:00pm will be assigned a grade of 0. How to hand in: similar to the labs, you will hand in your project via Quercus. Same rules as the assignments.
