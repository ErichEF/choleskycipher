# choleskycipher
An early project I did that involves an analysis of Cholesky Decomposition in Python, and trying to make something interesting out of it.

Looking at the code now, I can definitely improve on it given time, but equally I feel it to be an example of my application of an uncommon mathematical concept to
something possibly practical and interesting.

Please refer to README PDF folder for more detailed documentation and output. This was done using Python 3.8, numpy and scipy.
