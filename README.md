# choleskycipher
An early project I did that involves an analysis of Cholesky Decomposition in Python, and trying to make something interesting out of it.

Looking at the code now, I can definitely improve on it given time, but equally I feel it to be an example of my application of an uncommon mathematical concept to
something possibly practical and interesting.
